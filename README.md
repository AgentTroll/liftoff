# `liftoff`

SpaceX telemetry parser and modelling application written
in C++.

This takes the telemetry feed downloaded from SpaceX's
livestream and attempts to model the dynamic forces acting
on the rocket. The current iteration uses data from the
JCSAT-18/KACIFIC1 mission. The results are plotted using
MathGL's FLTK library as the model is updated. This then
uses the processed data in a new model that attempts to
replicate the rocket to validate the model and extract
other data such as thrust and other controls.

# Build

Requires MathGL headers and GMP to be installed on your
computer.

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/AgentTroll/liftoff.git
cd liftoff
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make

cd ..
./build/liftoff-cli/liftoff-cli
```

# Documentation

This project is extensively documented. The HTML version of
the documentation comments can be generated by running
